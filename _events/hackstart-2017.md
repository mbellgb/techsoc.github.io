Hackstart aims to inspire 14-17 year olds to take a deeper interest in Computer Science with a day of workshops and tech talks organised and run by first-year students at UCL. As students, we hope to pass on our passion for technology to young people and encourage them to follow us into the field we love.  
With topics ranging from game engineering to web design, a series of workshops will run throughout the day to cater for all abilities, from beginner to advanced. No previous experience in computer science is necessary, so don’t worry if you’ve never done any coding before or don’t know tonnes about computer science. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to learn some theory, get your hands on some code and speak to our current students about computer science.  
Lunch and snacks will be provided:D  
Just bring yourself, your friends, some enthusiasm and have fun!
