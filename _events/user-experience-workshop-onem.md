ONEm is a startup focused on providing technologies that allow the creation of interactive applications accessible through SMS and Voice services. These technologies are especially relevant in countries were 3G/4G are not available. Thanks to their services people can get information related to health and education by indirectly connecting to the internet through their cell phones.  
  
They will be running a workshop on User Experience. The event should be especially useful to all of you working on Systems Engineering projects related to app or web development.  
  
They will also bring some of their SIM cards so you can try out their SMS and Voice applications!
