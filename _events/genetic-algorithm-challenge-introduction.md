In collaboration with the Computer Science department we are hosting a Genetic Algorithm Challenge! We'll have a small game and you'll get the chance to create an algorithm that learns to play that game.   
  
This session is an introduction, where you'll learn what Genetic Algorithms are and how they can be used. Over the next 3 weeks we'll be hosting follow up sessions where you can gain points. The team with the highest score at the end wins!
