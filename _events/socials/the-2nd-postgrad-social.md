The second of its kind, this is a special social where we want to get as many post graduates along as possible. It'll be a great chance to meet others that have waved goodbye to their undergraduate degree, enjoy some free drinks, and talk about how easy years 1-3 were. Obviously it would be great to see some undergrads as well, and this is open to all! Hope to see you there!
