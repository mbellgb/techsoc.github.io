As spring breaks, it's time once again for a London Tech Society Mixer, and this time we're going south of the river!   
  
Following the last event's success, Goldsmiths' Hacksmiths, KCL Tech, Imperial's DoCSoc, UCL's TechSoc and City's Tech Society will be having a social mixer on the 13th March.  
  
If you belong to one of the tech societies, come along and meet the others. It's going to be a great, chill, evening.   
  
We look forward to seeing in you in The Stretch, Goldsmiths Students Union, at 7pm!   
  
Please remember to get your tickets on Eventbrite corresponding to your university (:  
  
See you there!
