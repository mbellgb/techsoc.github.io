This year TechSoc is hosting its first “Capture The Flag” competition: a game consisting of a series of challenges centered around computer security, cryptography, forensics and exploitation where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt or do whatever it takes to solve a challenge.  
  
The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked and range from extremely easy (“tic-tac-toe”) to impossible (“global thermonuclear war”). Each challenge will reward your team with a number of points, and the team with the most points wins.  
  
The event welcomes participants of all skill levels including complete beginners. Meals and snacks will be available for all participants and a team of mentors and security specialists will be ready around the clock to provide hints and advice.  
  
Tickets available below!
