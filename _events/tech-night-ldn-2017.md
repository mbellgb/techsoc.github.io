Tech Night LDN is a mini-conference embracing diversity by raising the visibility of accomplished women and underrepresented groups in tech and focussing on their achievements and knowledge.  
  
The evening will feature workshops, talks, panels and networking for people of all genders who are curious about technology. Expect an evening of inspiration and motivation!  
  
The event is open to all university students and graduates less than two years out of university of any technical skill level (including complete beginners) and best of all... it's absolutely free!
