Improbable are coming to UCL!  
  
In the last ten years, state-of-the-art game engines have become freely accessible to even the smallest studios and hobbyists, while also finding traction in industries elsewhere. Beyond video games the same tech is now heavily used in filmmaking, performance art and simulation. We'll look at the short history that lead us to their ubiquity, some of their most innovative current uses, and where this technology may be going. We'll then have a hands-on session, making use of a a game engine to see how similar the workflow and technology for gaming and non-gaming projects really can be.  
  
There will be food and drink, see you there.
