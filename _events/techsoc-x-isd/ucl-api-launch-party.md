It's finally happening. The UCL API is coming to life as part of this official launch party.  
Our first service is room bookings. You'll be able to make queries for rooms, bookings, and equipment.  
  
We'll be there to explain what the API can do, what some cool integrations are, and help you get started using it.  
  
Prepare for API awesomeness!
